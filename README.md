Instructions:
Recommended use in Arduino IDE.
Open serial monitor and make sure that Arduino is connected to a serial port on your computer. 
Set baud rate in serial monitor to 115200, or you can change it below but make sure your serial
monitor baud rate is always equal to BAUD-RATE.
Send valid 4 bit message such as "1111", "0000", "1101", "0100", etc. to the serial monitor. 
High or low value will be sent from pins 1-4 according to the message.
To send a new message just send a new four bit message in the serial monitor.
